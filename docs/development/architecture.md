# Pynector Architecture

This document provides an overview of Pynector's architecture, design patterns,
and key components.

## Core Design Principles

Pynector is built on several core design principles:

1. **Modularity**: Components are decoupled and can be used independently.
2. **Extensibility**: Transport system is pluggable and customizable.
3. **Reliability**: Built-in error handling, retries, and timeout mechanisms.
4. **Observability**: Integrated logging and tracing for monitoring and
   debugging.
5. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type hints throughout the codebase.

### Major Components

#### Client

The `Client` class provides a high-level interface for making requests. It
handles:

- Configuration and initialization of transport layers
- Request preparation and sending
- Response parsing and error handling
- Resource management (connections, etc.)

#### Transport Layer

The transport layer is responsible for the actual communication with external
services:

- **HTTP Transport**: Uses `httpx` to make HTTP/HTTPS requests.
- **SDK Transport**: Adapts existing Python SDKs into the Pynector interface.
- **Custom Transports**: Can be implemented by extending the base `Transport`
  protocol.

#### Concurrency Module

The concurrency module provides tools for handling asynchronous operations:

- **Task Management**: Creation, cancellation, and tracking of async tasks.
- **Concurrency Patterns**: Common async patterns like `gather`, `race`, etc.
- **Cancellation Support**: Proper cancellation handling for async operations.

#### Telemetry Module

The telemetry module handles observability concerns:

- **Logging**: Structured logging with context propagation.
- **Tracing**: Distributed tracing support with OpenTelemetry.
- **Metrics**: Basic performance metrics collection.

## Data Flow

A typical request flow through Pynector:

1. The user creates a `Client` with a specific configuration.
2. The user calls a method like `client.get()` or `client.post()`.
3. The client prepares the request and passes it to the appropriate transport.
4. The transport executes the request and returns a response.
5. The client wraps the response and returns it to the user.
6. Throughout this process, telemetry data is collected and can be exported.

## Error Handling

Pynector uses a hierarchical error system:

- Base `PynectorError` for all errors
- `RequestError` for connection issues, timeouts, etc.
- `ResponseError` for server-side errors
- Transport-specific errors (e.g., `HTTPError`, `SDKError`)

## Extension Points

Pynector can be extended through several mechanisms:

- **Custom Transports**: Implement the `Transport` protocol
- **Custom Adapters**: Create SDK adapters for specific services
- **Middleware**: Add request/response processing logic
- **Telemetry Integrations**: Connect to custom observability systems

## Configuration System

Pynector uses a central configuration system that allows:

- Global defaults
- Per-client configuration
- Per-request overrides
- Environment variable support
